# Civis

Civis is a social platform for Indian politics that allows users to generate and vote on user-generated polls and surveys periodically web-scraped from Indian news websites (like NDTV, TOI and ABP for now), with the aim to put opinion truly in the hands of the [‘Civis’](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/civis) (Latin for citizen).
Developed in Meteor.JS with:

<ul>
<li>meteorhacks:npm to enable usage of Node packages (such as Cheerio, for scraping) via NPM</li>
<li>http for requests</li>
<li>percolate:synced-cron to schedule server-side crons for periodic scraping of news websites like NDTV, TOI, ABP etc.</li>
<li>twbs:bootstrap</li>
<li>underscore.js</li>
<li>danappelxx:hover.css</li>
<li>FontAwesome</li>
</ul>
