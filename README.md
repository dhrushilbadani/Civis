# Civis

Civis is a social platform for Indian politics that allows users to generate and vote on user-generated polls and surveys periodically web-scraped from Indian news websites (like [NDTV](http://www.ndtv.com/us), [Times of India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/international-home) and [Mumbai Mirror](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/) for now), with the aim to put opinion truly in the hands of the [‘Civis’](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/civis) (Latin for citizen).
Developed in Meteor.JS with:

<ul>
<li>meteorhacks:npm to enable usage of Node packages (such as Cheerio, for scraping) via NPM</li>
<li>http for requests</li>
<li>percolate:synced-cron to schedule server-side crons for periodic scraping of news websites</li>
<li>twbs:bootstrap</li>
<li>underscore.js</li>
<li>danappelxx:hover.css</li>
<li>FontAwesome</li>
</ul>


##See it for yourself:
<ul>
<li> Grab the zip file from the pane on the right -> (feel free to git fork+pull the repository too!) </li>
<li> Run the terminal command "meteor" from within the civis/ directory. Civis should be up and running on your localhost! </li>
</ul>
