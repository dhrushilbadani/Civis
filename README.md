# Civis

Civis is a social platform for Indian politics that allows users to generate and vote on user-generated polls and surveys periodically web-scraped from Indian news websites (like NDTV, TOI and ABP for now), with the aim to put opinion truly in the hands of the ‘Civis’ (Latin for citizen).
Developed in Meteor.JS with:

<ul>
<li>meteorhacks:npm to enable usage of Node packages (such as Cheerio, for scraping) via NPM</li>
<li>http for requests</li>
<li>percolate:synced-cron to schedule server-side crons for periodic scraping of news websites like NDTV, TOI, ABP etc.</li>
<li>twbs:bootstrap</li>
<li>underscore.js)</li>
<li>danappelxx:hover.css</li>
</ul>


##Usage:
<ul>
<li> Grab the zip file from the pane on the right -> (feel free to git fork+pull the repository too!) </li>
<li> Type the command "meteor" from within the civis/ directory. </li>
</ul>
